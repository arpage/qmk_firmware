Once upon a time, I wasted a lot of time playing with keyboards 
and various keyboard related items.  

When I say keyboards, I'm talking about the kind used for computer input.  And specifically,
mechanical keyboards.  These keyboards work by closing a circuit with an actual electrical switch, as opposed 
to rubber dome keyboards which have the key top press down on a rubber pad, which closes a circuit when the key is 
pressed all the way to the bottom of it's travel

The advantage of the mechanical keyboard is that the switches don't have to be pressed all the way down before the 
electrical circuit is closed, activating the switch.  This can help prevent RSI by reducing the impact of bottoming 
out the switch.  

There are many types of switches used in mechanical keyboards, but most switches that are in current production as of
this writing are based on the
